def remove_URL_spaces_csv(doc, new_doc="New URL file"):
    """
    This function allows to remove all possible spaces presents in URLs, it's worth noting that the space must be represented with the following symbol: %.

    Parameters:
        First, a document of type '.csv' containing the links to be verified.
        The second can be a previously created '.csv' document or the name of the document you wish to be created for making the corrections, ending with the extension '.csv'.
    The function edits or creates the second document where in the first column displays a message with the status of the original URL, and the next one shows either the original URL or the new one depending on the status of the original URL.
        If the original URL contains any spaces, a message indicating this issue is returned, along with the number of spaces it contained and the same URL with all spaces removed and ready to be used!
        If the URL does not contain any spaces, a message indicating this is returned along with the original URL.
    Returns:
        The corresponding document.
